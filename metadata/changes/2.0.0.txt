2017-06-15 - 2.0.0

This release provides initial support for unRAID 6.4.x+.

The app is now reachable via both http and https.

When connecting via https, you'll get a warning since it
uses a self-signed certificate, but you can dismiss it.

It will generate the certificates if they're not present in
their default location (/boot/config/plugins/controlr).

You can use your own (maybe Let's Encrypt created), to
prevent the warning from showing at all.

Additionally, the following features/fixes were added:
- Upgraded packages
- Improved port detection
- Modified jwt secret generation
